# Integration Test Suite Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the AST Copilot Helper integration test suite, which was implemented as part of Issue #19 to ensure thorough testing of all system components and their interactions.

## Overview

The integration test suite consists of four major test categories that validate the entire system's functionality, performance, error handling, and external integrations:

1. **VS Code Extension Integration Tests**
2. **Performance Benchmarking Integration Tests**  
3. **Error Handling and Recovery Integration Tests**
4. **MCP Protocol Compliance Tests**

## Test Structure

All integration tests are located in the `tests/integration/` directory and follow a consistent structure:

```
tests/integration/
├── README.md                           # This documentation
