**Remaining Gap**: TypeScript grammar compatibility (tree-sitter-typescript 0.23.2 vs tree-sitter 0.21.1)

### Annotation Engine (90% Complete)

**Status**: 🟢 WELL_IMPLEMENTED  
**Key Components Discovered**:

- ✅ AnnotationEngine with language-specific extractors
- ✅ ComplexityAnalyzer with McCabe complexity calculation
- ✅ DependencyAnalyzer with import/export tracking

**Remaining Gaps**: Minor performance optimizations for large codebases

### Watch Command (95% Complete)

**Status**: 🟢 COMPREHENSIVE_IMPLEMENTATION  
**Key Components Discovered**:

- ✅ WatchCommand with chokidar integration
- ✅ IncrementalUpdateManager with batching/debouncing
- ✅ Complete processing pipeline (parse → annotate → embed)
- ✅ Database cleanup for deleted files
- ✅ Memory monitoring and session statistics

**Remaining Gaps**: Performance optimization for very large file sets
