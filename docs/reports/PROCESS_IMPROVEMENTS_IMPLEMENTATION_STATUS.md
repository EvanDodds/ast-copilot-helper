## Implementation Checklist

### 1. Code Organization Standards ✅

**Required Elements:**

- [x] Avoid stub files with TODOs when implementations exist elsewhere
- [x] Use clear module organization patterns
- [x] Add comments in stub files pointing to actual implementations

**Implementation:**

- **Primary Document**: `PROCESS_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (Section 1, lines 20-100)
- **Copilot Instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (lines 24-61)
- **Coverage**:
  - ✅ Clear guidance on avoiding misleading stubs
  - ✅ Handler pattern examples with ✅/❌ comparisons
  - ✅ Module organization best practices
  - ✅ Documentation standards for stub files

**Examples Provided:**

- TypeScript handler pattern (good vs bad)
- Rust re-export patterns
- Clear documentation in integration points

---

### 2. Documentation Synchronization ✅

**Required Elements:**

- [x] Regular audits to catch documentation drift
- [x] Automated checks for TODO comments vs actual implementations
- [x] Keep feature status reports synchronized with code

**Implementation:**

- **Primary Document**: `PROCESS_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (Section 2, lines 100-200)
- **Copilot Instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (lines 62-84)
- **Coverage**:
  - ✅ Monthly audit checklists defined
  - ✅ Automated TODO verification process documented
  - ✅ Feature status report template provided
  - ✅ Pre-commit hooks in place (`.husky/pre-commit`)

**Automation:**

- Pre-commit hooks detect Rust/TypeScript changes and run appropriate validators
- Documented automation approach for TODO vs implementation checks
- Template for feature status synchronization

---

### 3. Verification Before Flagging ✅

**Required Elements:**

- [x] When finding TODOs, verify if implementations exist in separate modules
- [x] Check for common patterns (handler stubs with implementations elsewhere)
- [x] Use semantic search in addition to grep for TODO comments

**Implementation:**

- **Primary Document**: `PROCESS_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (Section 3, lines 200-350)
- **Copilot Instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (lines 85-141)
- **Coverage**:
  - ✅ Multi-step verification process (4 steps)
  - ✅ Common patterns to check (3 patterns documented)
  - ✅ Semantic search techniques (4 approaches)
  - ✅ Documentation standards for flagging
  - ✅ Real examples from past false positives

**Verification Steps Documented:**

1. Context Analysis (read 20-30 lines around TODO)
2. Semantic Search (multiple search patterns)
3. Test Coverage Check (look for test files)
4. Runtime Verification (test if feature works)

**Common Patterns:**

1. Handler + Implementation split
2. Core module + Separate implementation
3. Registration + Handler class

---

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement

### Tracking Defined

**PROCESS_IMPROVEMENTS.md Section 5.2:**

- Number of false positives per audit
- Time spent on verification vs implementation
- Documentation drift frequency
- TODO comment accuracy rate

### Review Schedule

**Quarterly Review Checklist:**

- Are standards being followed?
- Have false positive rates decreased?
- New patterns to document?
- Additional tooling needed?
- Standards updates required?

## Verification Summary

### All Three Core Elements ✅

| Element                       | Primary Doc    | Copilot Instructions | Developer Guide | Status       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Code Organization Standards   | Section 1 (✅) | Lines 24-61 (✅)     | Referenced (✅) | **COMPLETE** |
| Documentation Synchronization | Section 2 (✅) | Lines 62-84 (✅)     | Referenced (✅) | **COMPLETE** |
| Verification Before Flagging  | Section 3 (✅) | Lines 85-141 (✅)    | Referenced (✅) | **COMPLETE** |
