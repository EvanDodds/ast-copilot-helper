## ❌ Failing Languages (4/18)

1. csharp - ❌ Native binding incompatible
2. dart - ❌ Native binding incompatible
3. lua - ❌ Native binding missing language export
4. php - ❌ Native binding incompatible

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis

- **Native Binding Issues**: The failing languages have native .node bindings that are incompatible with current Node.js/tree-sitter versions
- **ABI Mismatch**: Error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" indicates tree-sitter ABI version mismatch
- **WASM Fallback Hanging**: Grammar manager WASM fallback gets stuck on download/initialization

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Enhanced Grammar Manager**: Added `extractLanguageObject()` method to handle nested exports
2. **Added HTML Support**: Configured HTML language (was missing from languages.ts)
3. **Tree-sitter Version**: Upgraded to 0.22.4 for compatibility with newer language packages
4. **Module Loading**: Improved CommonJS/ESM compatibility for language module imports

### Success Rate: 78% (14/18 languages)

This represents a significant improvement from the initial 0% support to 78% specification compliance.
