# Process Improvements for ast-copilot-helper

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active

This document outlines process improvements derived from the comprehensive verification process that identified 19% false positives in the incomplete features inventory. These improvements aim to prevent similar issues in the future and maintain better synchronization between code and documentation.

---

## Background

During a comprehensive verification of the incomplete features inventory (October 2025), we discovered that 16 out of 83 identified "incomplete" items (19%) were actually false positives. These false positives occurred due to:

1. **Misleading stub files** with TODO comments while implementations existed in separate modules
2. **Documentation drift** between actual code state and feature status reports
3. **Incomplete verification** when flagging features as incomplete (grep-only searches vs. semantic analysis)

This document establishes standards to prevent these issues going forward.

---

## 1. Code Organization Standards

### Problem

Stub files with TODO comments created false impressions that features were unimplemented, when actual implementations existed in separate, dedicated modules.

**Example:** `packages/ast-core-engine/src/core.rs` contained placeholder modules with TODOs like "TODO: Implement vector database", while the actual `SimpleVectorDb` implementation existed in `vector_db.rs` (186 lines of production code).

### Standards

#### 1.1 Avoid Stub Files with Misleading TODOs

**❌ Don't:**

```rust
// core.rs
pub mod vector_db {
    // TODO: Implement vector database
    pub struct VectorDatabase;
}
```

**✅ Do:**

```rust
// core.rs
// Vector database implementation is in src/vector_db.rs
// Re-export for convenience
pub use crate::vector_db::SimpleVectorDb;
```

#### 1.2 Use Clear Module Organization Patterns

When functionality is implemented in a separate module:

1. **Delete stub files** if they serve no purpose
2. **Replace stubs with re-exports** if public API exposure is needed
3. **Add clear comments** pointing to actual implementations

**Pattern for Handlers:**

```typescript
// cli.ts - Handler registration
class WatchCommandHandler implements CommandHandler {
  async execute(options: WatchOptions): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation in commands/watch.ts (WatchCommand class)
    const watchCommand = new WatchCommand(config, logger);
    await watchCommand.start(options);
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Documentation in Stub Files

If a stub file must exist (e.g., for CLI handler registration), include clear documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * CLI handler for watch command
 *
 * This is a thin wrapper that delegates to the actual WatchCommand
 * implementation in commands/watch.ts.
 *
 * Implementation: src/commands/watch.ts (945 lines)
 * Features: File watching, incremental updates, debouncing, etc.
 */
class WatchCommandHandler implements CommandHandler {
  // ... handler code
}
```

---

## 2. Documentation Synchronization

### Problem

Feature status reports and documentation became out of sync with actual code state, leading to incorrect assessments of completeness.

**Example:** CACHE_CLI_COMMANDS.md contained "⚠️ Placeholder Command" warnings for fully implemented cache commands (cache:warm, cache:prune, cache:analyze).

### Standards

#### 2.1 Regular Documentation Audits

**Schedule:** Monthly or before major releases

**Audit Checklist:**

- [ ] Review all feature status documents
- [ ] Verify TODO comments against actual implementations
- [ ] Check for outdated "placeholder" or "not implemented" warnings
- [ ] Update completion percentages
- [ ] Verify documented features match exported APIs

**Automation:** Consider pre-commit hooks to check:

```bash
# Flag potential issues
git grep -n "TODO:" "*.rs" "*.ts" | \
  while read line; do
    # Check if corresponding implementation exists
    # Flag for manual review
  done
```

#### 2.2 Automated TODO vs Implementation Checks

**Tool Requirements:**

- Scan for TODO comments
- For each TODO, check if related implementation exists in other files
- Use semantic search, not just grep
- Generate report of potential false positives

**Example Check:**

```javascript
// When finding: TODO: Implement vector database
// Search for: class VectorDatabase, struct VectorDatabase, interface VectorDatabase
// Search in: Same package, related modules
// If found: Flag as "Implementation may exist - verify"
```

#### 2.3 Feature Status Report Synchronization

**When to Update:**

- ✅ After implementing features
- ✅ After discovering false positives
- ✅ Before releases
- ✅ During sprint planning

**Required Fields:**

- Implementation status (Implemented/Partial/Not Started)
- Location (file path and line numbers)
- Last verified date
- Test coverage status

**Template:**

```markdown
### Feature: Vector Database

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Location:** `packages/ast-core-engine/src/vector_db.rs` (lines 1-186)  
**Last Verified:** 2025-10-08  
**Test Coverage:** 94%  
**Known Issues:** None
```

## 3. Verification Before Flagging

### Problem

Features were flagged as incomplete based on surface-level grep searches for TODOs, without verifying if implementations existed in separate modules.

**Example:** MCP server tools were flagged as "CRITICAL - Missing implementations" because grep found registration lines containing "TODO", but the actual handler classes existed in the same file.

### Standards

#### 3.1 Multi-Step Verification Process

When finding a TODO or placeholder:

**Step 1: Context Analysis**

- Read 20-30 lines before and after the TODO
- Understand what the TODO is actually saying
- Check if it's a stub vs. an integration point

**Step 2: Semantic Search**

- Search for related class/function names
- Check common patterns:
  - Handler classes in separate files
  - Implementation in sibling modules
  - Re-exports from other packages

**Step 3: Test Coverage Check**

- Look for related test files
- Passing tests often indicate implementations exist
- Check test descriptions for feature confirmation

**Step 4: Runtime Verification**

- If possible, check if the feature actually works
- Run relevant commands/functions
- Verify output matches expected behavior

#### 3.2 Common Patterns to Check

Before flagging as incomplete, check these patterns:

**Pattern 1: Handler + Implementation Split**

```typescript
// cli.ts (may have TODO in handler)
class WatchCommandHandler {
  /* delegates to... */
}

// commands/watch.ts (actual implementation)
export class WatchCommand {
  /* 945 lines of code */
}
```

**Pattern 2: Core Module + Separate Implementation**

```rust
// core.rs (may have TODO stub)
pub mod vector_db { /* stub */ }

// vector_db.rs (actual implementation)
pub struct SimpleVectorDb { /* 186 lines of code */ }
```

**Pattern 3: Registration + Handler Class**

```typescript
// Registration with TODO-like comment
this.handlers.set("query_ast", new IntentQueryHandler());

// Actual handler implementation
class IntentQueryHandler implements ToolHandler {
  async execute() {
    /* full implementation */
  }
}
```

#### 3.3 Semantic Search Techniques

**Use multiple search approaches:**

1. **Class/Function Name Search:**

   ```bash
   # If TODO says "Implement vector database"
   rg "class VectorDatabase|struct VectorDatabase|interface VectorDatabase"
   ```

2. **Feature Keyword Search:**

   ```bash
   # If TODO says "Implement watch command"
   rg "watch.*command|command.*watch" -i --type ts
   ```

3. **Import/Export Search:**

   ```bash
   # Check what's actually exported
   rg "export.*VectorDatabase|export.*WatchCommand"
   ```

4. **Test Search:**
   ```bash
   # Check if tests exist
   find . -name "*watch*.test.ts" -o -name "*vector*.test.rs"
   ```

#### 3.4 Documentation Standards for Flagging

When flagging something as incomplete, document:

**Required Information:**

- Exact location (file, line numbers)
- What was searched (commands run, patterns used)
- What was NOT found (negative evidence)
- Context of the TODO (stub vs integration point)
- Verification steps taken

**Template:**

````markdown
### Item: Vector Database Implementation

**Classification:** CRITICAL - Implementation Missing  
**Location:** `packages/ast-core-engine/src/core.rs` line 23-30

**TODO Text:**

```rust
// TODO: Implement vector database
```
````

**Verification Steps:**

- [x] Searched for `VectorDatabase` class/struct: No results
- [x] Searched in `src/` directory: No results
- [x] Checked for tests: No test files found
- [x] Checked imports/exports: Not exported
- [x] Verified with semantic search: No related implementations found

**Conclusion:** Genuine gap, implementation needed.
