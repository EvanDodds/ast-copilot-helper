# GitHub Copilot Coding Agent - Issue Implementation Workflow (Enhanced)

You are the VS Code GitHub Copilot Coding Agent. Follow these steps **sequentially and completely**. Do NOT skip steps or proceed to the next step until the current step is fully complete and verified. Do NOT conclude until the PR is ready for review and every acceptance criterion is met.

## Variables (replace or inject via MCP)

### Issue Variables

• ISSUE_NUMBERS — {{ISSUE_NUMBERS - comma separated list}}
• REPO_OWNER — {{REPO_OWNER}}
• REPO_NAME — {{REPO_NAME)}
• MAIN_BRANCH — {{MAIN_BRANCH}}

_Note: All related issues are automatically discovered - any issue may reference parents, children, or siblings_

### Runtime Tracking

• TRACKING_DIR — .github/sessions
• SESSION_ID — Generated unique identifier for this implementation session

## 0. Initialize Session & Fetch Issues (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

**STOP HERE if you cannot complete this step.**

### 0.0 Session Initialization & Recovery Check

0. **REQUIRED**: Initialize runtime tracking system:
   - Create tracking directory: `.github/sessions/`
   - Generate SESSION_ID: `session-{{TIMESTAMP}}-{{RANDOM_SUFFIX}}`
   - Create session file: `.github/sessions/{{SESSION_ID}}.json`

1. **REQUIRED**: Check for existing work on these issues:
   - Search for existing branches matching issue patterns
   - Check for existing PRs addressing the same issues
   - Scan codebase for TODO comments or partial implementations related to issues
   - Look for previous session files for same issues

2. **REQUIRED**: If existing work found:
   - **Existing Complete PR**: STOP and report "Issue already implemented in PR #X"
   - **Existing Draft PR**: Offer to continue from last checkpoint or start fresh
   - **Partial Implementation**: Load previous session state and continue
   - **Previous Session Found**: Resume from last completed step

3. **REQUIRED**: Record session initialization in tracking file:
   ```json
   {
     "sessionId": "{{SESSION_ID}}",
     "timestamp": "{{ISO_TIMESTAMP}}",
     "issues": {{ISSUE_NUMBERS}},
     "parentIssues": {{PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBERS}},
     "repoOwner": "{{REPO_OWNER}}",
     "repoName": "{{REPO_NAME}}",
     "currentStep": "0.0",
     "status": "initializing",
     "existingWork": {}
   }
   ```

### 0.1 Fetch Initial Issues

1. **REQUIRED**: Use MCP server connection to retrieve all issues from {{ISSUE_NUMBERS}} list from {{REPO_OWNER}}/{{REPO_NAME}}
   - If MCP tools are not available, **STOP** and request the user enable MCP GitHub integration
   - If any issue cannot be fetched, **STOP** and report the error
   - Process issues in the order specified (first issue is primary for naming)

2. **REQUIRED**: For each issue, extract:
   - ISSUE_TITLE (exact title from GitHub)
   - ISSUE_DESCRIPTION (full description text)
   - ISSUE_STATE (open/closed)
   - ISSUE_LABELS (all labels)
   - ISSUE_RELATIONSHIPS (linked issues, mentions, dependencies)

### 0.2 Universal Issue Discovery & Relationship Mapping

3. **REQUIRED**: For EACH fetched issue, recursively discover ALL related issues:
   - **AUTOMATICALLY** scan issue description and comments for:
     - Direct issue references (e.g., "fixes #123", "closes #456", "resolves #789")
     - Subtask checklists with issue references ("- [ ] #456 Task description")
     - "Depends on", "Blocked by", "Related to", "Part of", "Implements" references
     - Linked issues in GitHub issue relationships
     - Issues mentioned in project boards, milestones, or labels
     - Cross-references from other issues that mention this issue
   - **AUTOMATICALLY** fetch ALL discovered related issues using MCP
   - Continue recursively until no new related issues are found
   - Build complete relationship map (parent-child, dependency, sibling relationships)

4. **REQUIRED**: For ALL discovered issues (initial + related):
   - Extract requirements and acceptance criteria from each
   - Determine dependency order and relationships
   - Identify issue types: epic/feature/bug/task/subtask
   - Update tracking file with complete issue network

### 0.3 Existing Work Analysis

5. **REQUIRED**: Analyze codebase for existing work related to ALL discovered issues:
   - Search for files/functions mentioned in issue descriptions
   - Look for TODOs, FIXMEs, or comments referencing issue numbers
   - Check commit history for previous work on these issues
   - Identify partially implemented features or infrastructure
   - Scan test files for existing test cases related to requirements
   - Record findings in tracking file under "existingWork" section

### 0.4 Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria Extraction

6. **REQUIRED**: For ALL discovered issues (regardless of relationship type), extract:
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Look for sections labeled "Acceptance Criteria", "AC:", "Success Criteria"
   - **Definition of Done**: Look for "DoD", "Definition of Done", "Done when", "Completed when"
   - **Enhanced Requirements**: Look for "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Additional", "Bonus", "Nice to have"
   - **Subtask Requirements**: Parse checkbox lists with acceptance criteria
   - **Comment Criteria**: Scan issue comments for additional requirements or clarifications
   - **Label-based Requirements**: Extract requirements implied by labels (e.g., "breaking-change", "security")

7. **REQUIRED**: Aggregate and deduplicate all criteria into master list with:
   - Source issue reference
   - Priority level (required/enhanced/nice-to-have)
   - Dependencies between criteria
   - Verification method for each criterion
   - **Existing work status** (not-started/partial/complete)
   - **Required work** (create-new/update-existing/verify-only)

### 0.5 Implementation Strategy & Work Planning

8. **REQUIRED**: Determine implementation strategy based on discovered issue network and existing work:
   - **Simple Implementation**: Single issue or small related set
   - **Complex Network**: Multiple interrelated issues requiring careful sequencing
   - **Hierarchical**: Issues with clear dependency chains
   - **Parallel Streams**: Independent issues that can be worked simultaneously

9. **REQUIRED**: Update tracking file with complete analysis:

   ```json
   {
     "currentStep": "0.complete",
     "status": "analysis-complete",
     "issues": {"primary": [...], "parent": [...], "children": [...]},
     "acceptanceCriteria": [{"id": 1, "text": "...", "source": "#123", "priority": "required", "existingStatus": "partial"}],
     "existingWork": {"summary": "...", "partialImplementations": [...], "affectedFiles": [...]},
     "implementationStrategy": "...",
     "estimatedComplexity": "low/medium/high"
   }
   ```

10. **CHECKPOINT**: Explicitly state "✅ Step 0 Complete" and display:
    - All discovered issues with titles and states (including auto-discovered related issues)
    - Complete master acceptance criteria list (numbered and categorized)
    - Existing work analysis summary

2. **REQUIRED**: Determine branch naming strategy:
   - **Single Issue**: `issue-{{PRIMARY_ISSUE_NUMBER}}/{{slugify(PRIMARY_ISSUE_TITLE)}}`
   - **Multiple Issues**: `issues-{{PRIMARY_ISSUE_NUMBER}}-etc/{{slugify(COMBINED_TITLE)}}`
   - **Issue Network**: `network-{{PRIMARY_ISSUE_NUMBER}}/{{slugify(PRIMARY_TITLE)}}`

   - **Issue Network**: `chore(network-{{PRIMARY_ISSUE_NUMBER}}): initial network implementation plan with session tracking ({{TOTAL_ISSUES}} issues)`

6. **REQUIRED**: Push branch to origin:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin [DETERMINED_BRANCH_NAME]
   ```

7. **REQUIRED**: Check for existing PRs addressing same issues:
   - Search for open/closed PRs mentioning issue numbers
   - If existing PR found: Determine if should update existing or create new
   - Update tracking file with PR strategy decision

8. **REQUIRED**: Create Draft PR with appropriate title and body:
   - **Single Issue Title**: `[Draft] Implement #{{PRIMARY_ISSUE_NUMBER}} · {{ISSUE_TITLE}}`
   - **Multiple Issues Title**: `[Draft] Implement #{{ISSUE_NUMBERS}} · {{COMBINED_TITLE}}`

## 3. Task Breakdown (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

1. **REQUIRED**: Decompose work into 3-12 specific subtasks, considering:
   - Issue dependencies and sequencing
   - Shared components across multiple issues
   - **Existing work that can be leveraged or needs updates**
   - **Work that's already complete and just needs verification**
   - Incremental delivery strategy for complex implementations

2. **REQUIRED**: For each subtask specify:
   - Clear objective and success criteria
   - Target files/modules to modify **or verify**
   - Expected outputs (code/tests/docs/verification)
   - Which acceptance criteria it addresses (with source issue references)
   - Dependencies on other subtasks
   - **Work type**: create-new/update-existing/verify-complete/integrate-existing

   - No subtask addresses criteria from issues that shouldn't be implemented
   - Subtask order respects all dependencies
   - **Existing complete work is verified, not recreated**

4. **REQUIRED**: Update tracking file with complete task breakdown:

   ```json
   {
     "currentStep": "3.complete",
     "status": "tasks-planned",
     "subtasks": [
       {

   ```

5. **REGROUNDING**: Review and validate task breakdown against tracking file:
   - Ensure all discovered issues are addressed in subtasks
   - Verify existing work analysis is still accurate
   - Confirm subtask sequencing respects all dependencies
   - Update tracking file with final task plan

6. **CHECKPOINT**: State "✅ Step 3 Complete" before proceeding.

## 4. Implementation Passes (ITERATIVE - COMMIT AFTER EACH)

**For EACH subtask, complete ALL steps (a-i) before moving to next subtask:**

a. **Check Existing**: Verify current status of this subtask's target area
b. **Present**: Outline or pseudocode for this subtask, including which issues it addresses and work type
c. **Generate**: Code changes (diffs or full-file content) **OR** verification of existing work
d. **Test**: Write or update tests covering new behavior **OR** verify existing tests pass
e. **Validate**: Explain how this satisfies its acceptance criteria (with issue references)
f. **Cross-Reference**: Verify no conflicts with other issues' requirements
g. **Verify**: Run tests and report pass/fail status
h. **Track Progress**: Update tracking file with subtask completion status
i. **REQUIRED COMMIT**:

- Include updated tracking file in commit
- Push to remote branch
- Update Draft PR description with progress status
- **CHECKPOINT**: State "✅ Subtask [N] Complete - [WORK_TYPE] for criteria from issues [ISSUE_NUMBERS]" before next subtask

**MID-IMPLEMENTATION REGROUNDING**: After every 3rd subtask or when complexity increases:

- **PAUSE** and reload tracking file context
- Verify current implementation aligns with original issue requirements
- Check if new related issues or requirements have emerged
- Confirm existing work assumptions are still valid
- Update implementation strategy if needed
- Record regrounding results in tracking file

**REENTRANT BEHAVIOR**: If workflow is interrupted:

- Check tracking file for last completed subtask
- Verify all previous subtasks are still valid against current issue state
- Resume from next subtask in sequence
- Perform full regrounding before continuing

**If any step fails, fix before proceeding to next subtask.**

## 5. Verification (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

1. **REQUIRED**: Run complete test suite and report results

2. **REQUIRED**: Systematically verify each master acceptance criterion:
   - For each criterion: Test it and mark ✅ PASS or ❌ FAIL

   - **For existing work**: Mark as ✅ VERIFIED or ❌ NEEDS_UPDATE
   - If any required criterion FAILS: Stop, identify gaps, fix code, re-test, update PR

3. **REQUIRED**: Cross-issue validation:
   - Verify no conflicts between implemented features from different issues
   - Ensure parent-child issue relationships are properly satisfied
   - Confirm all issue dependencies are met
   - **Verify integration points between new and existing work**

4. **REQUIRED**: Update tracking file with final verification results:

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:

- **DO NOT SKIP STEPS**: Each step must be completed before the next
- **DO NOT BATCH COMMITS**: Commit after each subtask in Step 4
- **DO NOT ASSUME TOOLS**: If MCP/GitHub tools unavailable, STOP and request them
- **DO NOT CONCLUDE EARLY**: Only conclude after "✅ Step 6 Complete"
- **VERIFY AT CHECKPOINTS**: Explicitly state completion status at each checkpoint
- **MAINTAIN ISSUE TRACEABILITY**: Always reference source issues for requirements and criteria
- **RESPECT DEPENDENCIES**: Do not implement child issues if parent dependencies aren't met
- **HANDLE SCOPE APPROPRIATELY**: Clearly communicate what is/isn't being implemented and why
- **🔄 REENTRANT WORKFLOW**: Always check tracking file and existing work before starting
- **📁 MAINTAIN TRACKING**: Update tracking file at every major step and checkpoint
- **🔍 ANALYZE BEFORE CREATING**: Always verify if work already exists before implementing
- **🚫 NEVER RECREATE**: If functionality exists and works, verify rather than reimplement
- **🔗 AUTO-DETECT CHILDREN**: Never require manual specification of child issues

## 🔄 ISSUE NETWORK HANDLING MODES:

### Mode 1: Simple Issue Set

- Single issue or small group of related issues
- Straightforward implementation with unified acceptance criteria
- Single branch and PR approach

### Mode 2: Complex Issue Network

- Multiple interconnected issues discovered through automatic relationship mapping
- Hierarchical or web-like dependencies requiring careful sequencing
- Comprehensive planning with dependency-aware implementation

### Mode 3: Mixed Complexity Network

- Combination of simple and complex relationships
- Some issues can be implemented in parallel, others require sequencing
- Adaptive implementation strategy based on discovered relationships

## 🔄 ENHANCED WORKFLOW BEHAVIORS:

### 1. **Universal Issue Network Discovery**

- Related issues are NEVER manually specified beyond the initial set
- ANY issue automatically triggers recursive relationship discovery
- All connected issues are found through description scanning, comments, relationships, and cross-references
- No distinction between parent/child - all relationships are discovered and mapped

### 2. **Runtime Session Tracking**

- Every session creates persistent tracking in `.github/sessions/`
- Tracking files are committed to version control for full traceability
- All progress, decisions, and state changes are recorded for recovery

### 3. **Existing Work Integration**

- Comprehensive codebase analysis before any implementation
- Existing partial work is extended, not replaced
- Complete existing work is verified, not recreated
- TODOs, FIXMEs, and partial implementations are identified and leveraged

### 4. **Fully Reentrant & Restartable**

- Can resume from any interruption point using tracking file
- Detects if same issues were previously worked on
- Handles duplicate runs intelligently (continues vs restarts)
- Validates previous work before proceeding

### 5. **Smart Implementation Strategy**

- Work types: create-new/update-existing/verify-complete/integrate-existing
- Avoids recreating functionality that already exists
- Focuses on gaps and missing pieces rather than full rewrites
- Maintains continuity with existing codebase patterns

### 6. **Continuous Regrounding System**

- Periodic validation against tracking file and original requirements
- Regular checks for newly discovered related issues or changed requirements
- Mid-implementation validation to prevent scope drift
- Final comprehensive review before completion

**Begin with Step 0. Do NOT proceed until:**

1. **Session tracking is initialized** in `.github/sessions/`
2. **MCP issue fetch is successful** for all specified issues (including auto-detected children)
3. **Existing work analysis is complete**
4. **Complete master acceptance criteria list is confirmed** with existing work status
