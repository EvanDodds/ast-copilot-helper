### What Changed (Since 90% Completion)

Add this section to explain what was completed:

```markdown
## What's New - Database Size Measurement

**Completed:** AC #7 - Database Size Documentation

**Implementation:**

- Added `measureDatabaseSize()` function to `comprehensive-benchmark.ts`
- Measures SQLite database file + WAL/SHM files
- Calculates growth metrics: bytes per node, bytes per LOC, index overhead

**Measured Results:**

- Total database size: 96KB (0.09 MB)
- Bytes per node: 201 bytes
- Bytes per LOC: 27 bytes
- Index overhead: 0.53x (indexed data more compact than source)
- Extrapolated for 100k nodes: ~18MB

**Documentation Updates:**

- `PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`: New Section 5.4 with full analysis
- `SPECIFICATION_FEATURE_EVALUATION.md`: Section 8.1 table updated
- `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_VALIDATION.md`: AC #7 marked as PASSED

**Validation:**

- Database is 91% smaller than 200MB specification target
- 182MB of storage headroom available
- Storage efficiency: 0.53x overhead (better than raw source)
- Highly scalable with linear growth rate
```

### Files Changed Summary

Update the files changed summary to include database measurement work:

```markdown
