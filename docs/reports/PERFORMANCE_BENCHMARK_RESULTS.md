## 2. Parsing Performance Benchmarks

### 2.1 Specification Targets

**Target:** <10 minutes for full repository parsing (Rust engine on 2-CPU 8GB CI runner)

**Context:** 100,000 significant AST nodes (~667,000 lines of code)

### 2.2 Measured Results

| Test                 | Mean Duration | Median Duration | P95 Latency  | Iterations |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **parse-typescript** | 31,720.77 ms  | 31,721.85 ms    | 31,779.76 ms | 3          |
| **parse-javascript** | 31,668.72 ms  | 31,634.22 ms    | 31,743.05 ms | 3          |
| **parse-python**     | 31,617.11 ms  | 31,606.49 ms    | 31,654.11 ms | 3          |

**Summary Statistics:**

- **Average per file:** ~31.7 seconds
- **Total parsing time (3 files):** ~95 seconds (1.6 minutes)
- **Consistency:** Very stable (stddev: 27-53ms across tests)

### 2.3 Analysis

#### 2.3.1 Per-File Performance

The specification target of "<10 minutes for full repository" applies to a **full repository** (100k nodes / 667k LOC), not individual files. Our test files average:

- **TypeScript:** 1,412 LOC → 31.7s parsing time
- **JavaScript:** 1,139 LOC → 31.7s parsing time
- **Python:** 1,129 LOC → 31.6s parsing time

**Extrapolation to Full Repository:**

Using the specification's language density estimates:

- TypeScript: ~1 node per 6-8 LOC → 1,412 LOC = ~177-235 nodes
- JavaScript: ~1 node per 6-8 LOC → 1,139 LOC = ~142-190 nodes
- Python: ~1 node per 8-12 LOC → 1,129 LOC = ~94-141 nodes

**Total nodes in test repository:** ~413-566 nodes (much smaller than 100k)

**Projected full repository parsing time:**

- 100,000 nodes / 566 nodes = ~177x larger
- 95 seconds × 177 = **16,815 seconds (~4.7 hours)**

#### 2.3.2 Specification Compliance

⚠️ **DOES NOT MEET SPECIFICATION TARGET** when extrapolated to full repository scale.

**Possible Causes:**

1. Test files may have unusual complexity (service layers, validation, error handling)
2. Parsing overhead includes database writes, not just tree-sitter parsing
3. Specification target may assume batch-optimized parsing (our test parses files individually)
4. CI runner performance characteristics differ from test environment

**Recommendation:**

1. Update specification with realistic per-file parsing benchmarks
2. Add batch parsing optimizations to reduce per-file overhead
3. Measure parsing performance on actual large repositories (not synthetic)
4. Consider implementing parse result caching to skip unchanged files

### 2.4 Memory Usage (Parsing)

| Test                 | Heap Used | Heap Total | RSS    |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------ |

## 5.4 Database Size Measurement

### 5.4.1 Specification Targets

**Target:** <200MB for indexed repository

### 5.4.2 Measured Results

| Metric                  | Value           |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **Total database size** | 0.094 MB (96KB) |
| **Database file**       | 64 KB           |
| **WAL/SHM files**       | 32 KB           |
| **Bytes per AST node**  | 201 bytes       |
| **Bytes per LOC**       | 27 bytes        |
| **Index overhead**      | 0.53x           |

**Per-Table Breakdown:**

The database size measurement now includes detailed per-table analysis using SQLite's `dbstat` virtual table:

| Table Category     | Description                                   | Size (bytes) | Size (KB) | % of Total |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |

| **Parser Results** | AST nodes, parse trees, syntax information    | 8,192        | 8 KB      | 18.2%      |
| **Metadata**       | File information, configuration, statistics   | 4,096        | 4 KB      | 9.1%       |
| **Other**          | Miscellaneous tables and overhead             | 4,096        | 4 KB      | 9.1%       |
| **Annotations**    | LLM-generated code annotations and metadata   | 0            | 0 KB      | 0%         |
| **Embeddings**     | Vector embeddings for semantic search         | 0            | 0 KB      | 0%         |
| **Total**          |                                               | **45,056**   | **44 KB** | **100%**   |

**Key Insights:**

- **Indexes dominate storage** (64%): This is expected and efficient - indexes enable fast queries
- **Parser results are compact** (18%): AST storage is very space-efficient at 8KB for 490 nodes
- **No annotations/embeddings yet**: These features will be benchmarked in Issue #181
- **Efficient categorization**: The breakdown helps identify optimization opportunities for future growth

### 5.4.3 Analysis

✅ **EXTREMELY EFFICIENT STORAGE**

**Storage Characteristics:**

- **Total size:** 96 KB (0.048% of 200MB target)
- **Per-node overhead:** 201 bytes per AST node
- **Per-line overhead:** 27 bytes per line of code
- **Index overhead:** 0.53x (indexed data is smaller than source!)

**Extrapolation to Full Repository:**

Using the measured growth rates:

- **For 100k nodes:** 201 bytes × 100,000 = **19.2 MB**
- **For 667k LOC:** 27 bytes × 667,000 = **17.2 MB**
- **Average estimate:** **~18 MB for full repository**

**Storage Margin:**

- Projected usage for 100k nodes: **18 MB**
- Specification target: <200MB
- **Available headroom:** 182 MB (91% unused)

**Key Findings:**

1. **Highly efficient indexing:** Index overhead is 0.53x, meaning the indexed data is more compact than raw source
2. **Scalable storage:** At 201 bytes/node, even 1M nodes would only require ~191 MB
3. **Well within specification:** Projected full repository size is 10x under target
4. **Consistent overhead:** Linear growth per node and per LOC

**Database Breakdown:**

- **Main database (index.db):** 64 KB - Stores AST metadata, parse results, relationships
- **WAL/SHM files (index.db-wal/shm):** 32 KB - SQLite Write-Ahead Log and shared memory
- **Total overhead:** Minimal (~1KB per file processed)

**Implications:**

- Database size will not be a constraint for realistic codebases
- Storage efficiency enables local caching on developer machines
- No compression needed - native SQLite storage is highly efficient
- Room for additional metadata (annotations, embeddings) without approaching limits

## 6. Comparison to Specification Targets

### 6.1 Performance Target Summary

| Category        | Specification Target | Measured Result | Status | Variance       |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| **Parse**       | <10 min (full repo)  | ~32s per file   | ⚠️     | N/A \*         |
| **Annotate**    | <5 min (full repo)   | Not measured    | ⏳     | Pending        |
| **Embed**       | <15 min (full repo)  | Not measured    | ⏳     | Pending        |
| **Query (P95)** | <200ms               | 59.41ms         | ✅     | -70% (faster)  |
| **Memory**      | <4GB                 | 141MB           | ✅     | -96.6% (lower) |
| **DB Size**     | <200MB               | 18MB (est.)     | ✅     | -91% (smaller) |

\* Parsing target applies to full 100k-node repository, not individual files. Extrapolation suggests ~4.7 hours for full repository (47x slower than target), indicating specification may need adjustment or batch optimizations required.

### 6.2 Recommendation: Specification Updates

Based on empirical measurements, recommend the following specification adjustments:

#### 6.2.1 Parsing Performance

**Current Specification:**

> Parse: <10 minutes for full repository (Rust engine)

**Recommended Update:**

> **Parse:** <10 minutes for full repository (100k nodes) with batch processing  
> **Parse (per file):** ~30-40 seconds for medium-sized files (1000-1500 LOC)  
> **Parse (variance):** ±10% based on code complexity and language

**Rationale:** Individual file parsing takes ~32s for 1000-1400 LOC files. Full repository parsing should leverage batch optimizations (transaction batching, parallel parsing, skip unchanged files) to meet <10 minute target.

#### 6.2.2 Query Performance

**Current Specification:**

> Query: <200ms P95 latency for top-5 results (SQLite + HNSW)

**Recommended Update:**

> **Query:** <100ms P95 latency for top-5 results (SQLite + HNSW)  
> **Query (variance):** ±10% based on database size and query complexity

**Rationale:** Measured P95 latency is 59.41ms (70% faster than target). Tightening target to 100ms provides realistic safety margin while reflecting actual performance capabilities.
