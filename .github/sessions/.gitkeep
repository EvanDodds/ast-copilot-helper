# Session Tracking Directory

This directory contains session tracking files for GitHub Copilot Coding Agent implementations.

Each session file (`session-{{TIMESTAMP}}-{{RANDOM_SUFFIX}}.json`) tracks:
- Issue network discovery and relationships
- Implementation progress and decisions
- Acceptance criteria verification
- Existing work analysis
- Reentrant workflow state

Session files are committed to version control for full traceability and recovery capabilities.
