## 🚧 Known Limitations

### 1. Synthetic Repository Node Count

**Issue:** Test repository contains ~500 AST nodes instead of 100k target  
**Impact:** Minimal - per-file performance metrics still valid  
**Resolution:** Documented in performance report with extrapolation methodology  
**Severity:** Low

### 2. Database Size Not Measured

**Issue:** AC #7 not completed - database size after indexing not documented  
**Impact:** Missing one performance metric  
**Resolution:** Defer to future enhancement issue  
**Severity:** Medium

### 3. Annotation/Embedding Benchmarks

**Issue:** Annotation and embedding benchmarks not implemented  
**Impact:** Minimal - these features don't exist in current system yet  
**Resolution:** Document as N/A until features are implemented  
**Severity:** Low

## 📋 Future Work

### High Priority

1. 📌 **Database Size Measurement** - Measure SQLite file size after indexing, track growth rate
2. 📌 **Parsing Optimizations** - Implement batch processing to meet <10 minute target for full repository

### Medium Priority

3. 📋 **Annotation Benchmarks** - Add when annotation system is implemented
4. 📋 **Embedding Benchmarks** - Add when embedding generation is implemented
5. 📋 **Performance Trends** - Track performance over time with historical baseline comparison

### Low Priority

6. 📋 **Extended Test Repository** - Expand synthetic repository to full 100k nodes if more accurate extrapolation needed
7. 📋 **Multi-Environment Testing** - Test on different hardware configurations (2-CPU 8GB VM, ARM64, etc.)
