The GitHub Copilot agent does not have write permissions to post comments to PRs directly.
All necessary content and automation has been prepared - only the final posting step requires manual action.

1. Review with stakeholders
2. Address any feedback
3. Proceed with merge approval
4. Follow post-merge recommendations (lint cleanup, etc.)
