# Security Documentation

## Overview

The AST Copilot Helper project includes a comprehensive security framework designed to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure secure AST processing workflows. This document provides detailed information about the security architecture, features, and best practices.

## Security Architecture

### Core Security Components

The security framework is built around four primary components that work together to provide comprehensive protection:

#### 1. ComprehensiveSecurityAuditor

**Location**: `packages/ast-helper/src/security/auditor.ts`

The security auditor performs comprehensive security assessments with the following capabilities:

- **Multi-Framework Compliance**: Supports OWASP, CWE, and NIST security frameworks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability assessment of project dependencies
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk scoring with severity classification
- **Audit Reporting**: Detailed security reports with remediation recommendations
- **Policy Enforcement**: Configurable security policies with compliance validation

**Key Features**:

- 6 comprehensive audit sections covering all security domains
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Risk scoring algorithms based on industry standards
- Detailed remediation guidance and best practice recommendations
- Integration with external security databases and threat intelligence

#### 2. ComprehensiveInputValidator

**Location**: `packages/ast-helper/src/security/input-validator.ts`

Advanced input validation and sanitization engine with the following protections:

- **XSS Protection**: Detection and prevention of cross-site scripting attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Pattern-based detection of SQL injection attempts
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Protection against command execution vulnerabilities
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevention of directory traversal attacks
- **Data Type Validation**: Strict type checking and format validation
- **Context-Aware Sanitization**: Input sanitization based on usage context

**Supported Validation Types**:

- Text input sanitization with XSS pattern detection
- Numeric input validation with range checking
- Array and object validation with depth limits
- File path validation with traversal protection
- Command input validation with injection prevention
- Custom validation rules with extensible rule engine

#### 3. VulnerabilityScanner

**Location**: `packages/ast-helper/src/security/vulnerability-scanner.ts`

Pattern-based vulnerability detection system with comprehensive coverage:

- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Detection of embedded passwords, API keys, and secrets
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, and command injection patterns
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak encryption, insecure hashing, and crypto misuse
- **Configuration Vulnerabilities**: Insecure configurations and default credentials
- **Code Quality Issues**: Security-relevant code smells and anti-patterns

**Vulnerability Categories**:

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass
- **High**: Data exposure, privilege escalation
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, denial of service
- **Low**: Best practice violations, hardening recommendations

#### 4. SecurityHardeningFramework

**Location**: `packages/ast-helper/src/security/security-hardening-framework.ts`

Security policy enforcement and configuration management system:

- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) validation
- **Permission Management**: Fine-grained permission checking
- **Security Policies**: Configurable security policy enforcement
- **Compliance Checking**: Automated compliance validation
- **Security Baselines**: Industry-standard security baseline enforcement

**Policy Categories**:

- Authentication and authorization policies
- Data encryption and protection policies
- Network security and communication policies

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all security unit tests
yarn test packages/ast-helper/src/security/

# Run security integration tests
yarn test tests/integration/security-integration.test.ts

# Run specific security test suites
yarn test tests/unit/security/core-architecture.test.ts
yarn test tests/unit/security/input-validation-system.test.ts

# Run complete security test suite
yarn run test:security
```

## Security Configuration

### Default Configuration

The security framework uses a comprehensive default configuration that can be customized:

```typescript
import { DEFAULT_SECURITY_CONFIG } from "packages/ast-helper/src/security/config";

const config = {
  // Audit Configuration
  auditLevel: "comprehensive",
  dependencyScanning: true,
  complianceFrameworks: ["OWASP", "CWE", "NIST"],

  // Input Validation Configuration
  validation: {
    enableSanitization: true,
    strictMode: true,
    customRules: [],
    contextAware: true,
  },

  // Vulnerability Scanning Configuration
  scanning: {
    patternMatching: true,
    riskScoring: true,
    findingCategories: ["critical", "high", "medium", "low"],
  },

  // Security Hardening Configuration
  hardening: {
    policyEnforcement: true,
    complianceChecking: true,
    accessControl: true,
  },
};
```

### Custom Security Policies

You can define custom security policies by extending the base configuration:

```typescript
import { SecurityConfig } from "packages/ast-helper/src/security/types";

const customConfig: SecurityConfig = {
  ...DEFAULT_SECURITY_CONFIG,
  validation: {
    ...DEFAULT_SECURITY_CONFIG.validation,
    customRules: [
      {
        name: "custom-email-validation",
        pattern: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/,
        message: "Invalid email format",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

2. **Do** report security issues through GitHub's private security advisory system
3. **Do** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Do** allow reasonable time for us to address the issue before public disclosure

### Security Advisory Process

1. **Initial Report**: Submit detailed vulnerability report
2. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
3. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates the vulnerability
4. **Resolution**: We develop and test a fix
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure after fix is available

### Bug Bounty

We do not currently offer a bug bounty program, but we recognize and appreciate security researchers who help improve our security through responsible disclosure.
