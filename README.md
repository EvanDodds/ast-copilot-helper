## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of codebases and serving that data through a Model Context Protocol server. It consists of three main packages:

- **`ast-helper`** - CLI data processor that builds `.astdb/` database from source code
- **`ast-mcp-server`** - MCP protocol server that serves AST data from the database
- **`vscode-extension`** - VS Code extension for managing AST helper processes (optional)

## 🌐 Language Support

AST Copilot Helper supports **15 programming languages** organized into 3 tiers:

| Tier | Languages | Use Cases |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **🏢 Enterprise** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, C# | Production applications, enterprise codebases |
| **👩‍💻 Developer** | Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Swift | Popular development languages, strong community |
| **🎯 Specialized** | Kotlin, Scala, Dart, Lua | Domain-specific, emerging technologies |

### Quick Example

```typescript
import { ParserFactory } from '@ast-copilot-helper/ast-helper';

// Create parser for any supported language
const parser = await ParserFactory.createParser();

// Parse TypeScript
const tsResult = await parser.parseCode('function hello(): string { return "world"; }', 'typescript');

// Parse Python  
const pyResult = await parser.parseCode('def hello() -> str:\n    return "world"', 'python');

// Parse Go
const goResult = await parser.parseCode('func hello() string {\n    return "world"\n}', 'go');
```

## Development

### Building

Build all packages:

```bash
yarn run build
```

Build and watch for changes:

```bash
yarn run build:watch
```

### Testing

We have a multi-tiered testing strategy optimized for both development speed and comprehensive validation:

### Testing Strategy

We use a multi-tiered testing approach optimized for different development phases:

#### Git Hook Testing (Automated)

- **Pre-commit** (~30-45 seconds): Essential unit tests + type checking + linting
  - Runs fastest subset to catch basic issues before commit
  - Prevents broken code from entering the repository
- **Pre-push** (~1-2 minutes): Comprehensive fast tests + build verification
  - All tests except performance benchmarks
  - Ensures code is ready to be shared/reviewed

#### Manual Testing Commands

```bash
# Essential unit tests only (fastest, used by pre-commit)
yarn run test:unit

# Fast comprehensive tests (used by pre-push, excludes benchmarks)
yarn run test:fast
yarn run test:precommit  # Alias for test:fast

# Integration and end-to-end tests
yarn run test:integration

# Complete test suite including performance benchmarks
yarn run test:all  # Takes 5-7 minutes, use sparingly
```

#### Performance & Benchmarks

```bash
# Performance benchmarks (slowest tests)
yarn run test:benchmarks
```

#### Comprehensive Testing

```bash
# Run ALL tests (unit + integration + benchmarks) - use for thorough validation
yarn run test:all
yarn run test:dev        # Same as above
yarn run test:comprehensive  # Same as above
```

#### With Coverage

```bash
yarn run test:coverage
```

**Git Hook Strategy:**

- **Pre-commit**: Fast tests only (type-check, lint, fast unit tests, build)
- **Pre-push**: Comprehensive tests (unit + integration, skip benchmarks)
- **Manual/CI**: All tests including performance benchmarks

### Type Checking

Check TypeScript types across all packages:

```bash
yarn run typecheck
```

### Package-Specific Commands

You can run commands in specific packages:

```bash
# Run commands in ast-helper package
cd packages/ast-helper
yarn run build
yarn run dev
yarn test

# Run commands in ast-mcp-server package
cd packages/ast-mcp-server
yarn run build
yarn run dev
yarn test

# Run commands in vscode-extension package
cd packages/vscode-extension
yarn run build
yarn run dev
yarn test
```

## Security Framework

This project includes a comprehensive security framework designed to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure secure AST processing workflows.

### Security Features

   - Real-time risk scoring and finding categorization

4. **SecurityHardeningFramework** (`packages/ast-helper/src/security/security-hardening-framework.ts`)
   - Security policy enforcement and configuration management
   - Access control validation and permission management
   - Security baseline compliance checking

### Security Testing

Comprehensive test coverage ensures security framework reliability:

- **14 Integration Tests**: End-to-end security workflow testing
- **Real-world Scenarios**: SQL injection, XSS, cryptographic vulnerability testing
- **Performance Validation**: Security operations under load testing

Run security tests:

```bash
# All security unit tests
yarn test packages/ast-helper/src/security/

# Integration security tests
yarn test tests/integration/security-integration.test.ts

# Complete security test suite
yarn run test:security
```

### Security Configuration

Security settings are configured via the security config system:

```typescript
import { DEFAULT_SECURITY_CONFIG } from "packages/ast-helper/src/security/config";

// Default security configuration includes:
// - OWASP/CWE/NIST compliance frameworks
// - Input validation rules and sanitization
// - Vulnerability detection patterns
// - Security hardening policies
```

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
